# caesar
Formerly known as the Consolidated AES Automated Runtime, now it's just CAESAR.

This is an honest attempt to convert six-year-old VB.NET code to nice, updated C# 6.0 code.

This project is still in development and is not ready for production use. As of 29 Mar 2016, CAESAR has been released and works. See [the wiki](https://github.com/therealartifex/caesar/wiki) for more information about the software itself.

_Please note that you will need to run a nuget package restore in order to build this project._

# caesar
Consolidated AES Automated Runtime

This is an honest attempt to convert six-year-old VB.NET code to nice, updated C# 6.0 code.

This project is still in development and is not ready for general use. See [here](https://github.com/therealartifex/caesar/milestones/First%20Successful%20Operation) for a list of things that need to be completed for the first release. See [the wiki](https://github.com/therealartifex/caesar/wiki) for more information about the software itself.

_Please note that you will need to run a nuget package restore in order to build this project._
